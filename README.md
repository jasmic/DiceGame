# DiceGame
A project created for the OCR J277 computer science GCSE NEA

We have been asked to develop a two-player dice game. 
The players roll two 6-sided dice each and get points depending on what they roll. 
There are 5 rounds in a game. 
In each round, each player rolls the two dice. 

The rules are:
The points rolled on each player’s dice are added to their score.
\nIf the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score.
\nIf the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score.
\nIf they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points rolled added to their score.
\nThe score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point.
\nThe person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins.
\nIf both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins). 
\nOnly authorised players can play the game. 
\nWhere appropriate, input from the user should be validated. 

Design, develop, test and evaluate a program that:
\nAllows two players to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are authorised players.
\nAllows each player to roll two 6-sided dice.
\nCalculates and outputs the points for each round and each player’s total score.
\nAllows the players to play 5 rounds.
\nIf both players have the same score after 5 rounds, allow each player to roll 1 die until someone wins.
\nOutputs who has won at the end of the 5 rounds.
\nStores the winner’s score, and their name, in an external file.
\nDisplays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.
